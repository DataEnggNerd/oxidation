### Oxidation of a Pythonista

This repository is containing code of my daily learning of Rust as a second programming language after Python. 

#### First learning source:

Eventhough I wanted to start with Rust book, it is bit overwhelming for me, as the only programming language I have known so far is Python. Based on a friend's recommendation, found this gem - [Python to Rust](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEIv4NBmh-GsWGE9mY3sF9c5lgh5Z_jLr). 

Thanks to @bedroombuilds for such amazing work to make this as an apples to apples comparison.
